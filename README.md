# Abeeway Battery Life Time Estimation Tool
The 'abeeway_battery_standalone.html' file includes all html and javascript code of the tool. 
Try it out (served from github) 
[here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/norbertherbert/abeeway_battery/blob/main/abeeway_battery_standalone.html).

Please note, that you can open the file in a web browser from a local file system even without a web server.

The 'abeeway_battery.html' file uses the separate 'abeeway_battery.js' node module. If you want to test the 'abeeway_battery.js' node module, use the `node test.js` command.
